Payments:

All payments are made as probablistic micropayments using 160 byte 'lottery vouchers', containing, in order:
|offset|size|    Rust type  |    content    |
|------|----|---------------| ------------- |
|  0   | 4  |      u32      |  oracleBlock  |
|  4   | 4  |      u32      |  difficulty   |
|  8   | 4  |      u32      | noRedeemBeforeBlock |
| 12   | 4  |      u32      | valueIfPaid   |
| 16   | 16 |      u128     | priceListCommit = Hash(stringification) % 2^128 |
| 32   | 96 | bytes[32] [3] | [senderPubKey, recipientPubKey, nonce = Hash(Hash(url))]  |
| 128  | 32 |   bytes[32]   | Sr25519Sig( ^bytes 0-127^ )  |

A difficulty of 1 implies P(payment) = 1
A difficulty of 5000 means that, on average, only 1 in every 5000 vouchers can be paid out.


The values `priceListCommit`, `difficulty` and `sesh = XOR(senderPubKey, recipientPubKey) % 2^10` are stored by the two nodes in a session for the duration of the session.

`nonce` is deterministically derived from the url of a given request

`oracleBlock` and `noRedeemBeforeBlock` are generated by the requesting client, based on the block height at the time of the request. It is anticipated that mismatches in block height between the nodes will be unimportant, except where they cause a mismatch of eras (see later). These will be sent by the client to the guillotine node at the time of request, and agreed by the node in its mid-response request for payment.

`valueIfPaid` is set by the guillotine node according to the session's priceList and will be communicated to the client node in the mid-request response for payment.

`oracleBlock % 2^10` gives the block number _within_ that 1024-block era, and `XOR(sesh, nonce%2^10, oracleBlock%2^10) = 0`

`Math.floor(oracleBlock/ 2^10)` gives the era in which the oracle block falls, which will be in the next era.

`noRedeemBeforeBlock`is two eras on from the current block, giving hobby users approximately 1 hour 40 minutes to arrange to claim first in case of competing claims on limited funds.
